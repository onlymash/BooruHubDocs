# Privacy Policy

## Introduction
BooruHub respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy will inform you about how we look after your personal data when you use our app and tell you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

## Important Information and Who We Are
This privacy policy aims to give you information on how BooruHub collects and processes your personal data through your use of this app.

## The Data We Collect About You
BooruHub does not collect any personal data from its users. We do not collect, store, or share any information that could be used to identify you personally. However, the app does interact with external Booru servers, which may have their own data collection practices.

## How We Use Your Data
Since BooruHub does not collect any personal data, we do not use, store, or share any user data. The app solely functions to connect to Booru imageboard servers based on the information you provide (such as the Booru root URL).

## Data Security
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your data from being accidentally lost, used, accessed in an unauthorized way, altered, or disclosed. Although we do not collect personal data, we ensure that the app operates in a secure manner.

## Third-Party Links
BooruHub may contain links to third-party websites, plug-ins, and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements.

## Your Legal Rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. However, since BooruHub does not collect personal data, these rights are not applicable to our app. For data handled by external Booru servers, you should refer to the privacy policies of those specific servers.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes we make will be posted on this page, and if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice.
